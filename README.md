### Hey, I'm JoÃ£o Lucas! :v:
<br>
<p>ðŸŒ± I'm an Information Systems sophomore student at UFMG - Federal University of Minas Gerais. I'm based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.</p>
<br>

<p>âš¡ I'm passionate about how mathematics can impact people's lives through computer science, and I strongly believe that those who have solid computational skills should contribute to a better world, even a little.</p>
<br>

><p>"Computer science inverts the normal. In normal science, you're given a world, and your job is to find out the rules. In computer science, you give the computer the rules, and it creates the world." - Alan Kay</p>
<br>

<p>ðŸ”­I'm currently working on a project aiming to raise the visibility of a non-profit organization - <a href="https://cddown.org/">CDDown</a> - that help people with mental disabilities. Besides that, I'm looking for broaden my knowledge in Data Analytics and learn Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<br>

### What I'm focusing on :computer: :hearts:
